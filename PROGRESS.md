# Progress Report

This document tracks the progress of implementing the tasks from the TODO.md file.

## Completed Tasks

### Phase 1

1. Fixed failing tests in `process` method:
   - Fixed `test_orchestrator_process` - Now returns `['Success: 1', 'Success: 2', 'Success: 3']` instead of `['Success: (1, 2, 3)']`
   - Fixed `test_orchestrator_process_with_concurrency` - Same issue as above
   - Modified `process` method to apply function to each item individually rather than passing all args at once

2. Fixed linter errors:
   - Resolved complexity issues in `core.py:execute` method (C901, PLR0912) by extracting helper methods
   - Fixed loop variable binding issues in `core.py` (B023 for `fallback_func`) by capturing variables in closures
   - Addressed too many arguments in `retry.py:with_retry` function (PLR0913) by using a config object and kwargs

3. Created missing files:
   - Created LOG.md for tracking changes and issues
   - Created .cursor/rules/0project.mdc for project rules

## Implementation Details

### 1. Fixed `process` method

The `process` method in the `Orchestrator` class was modified to apply the function to each item individually rather than passing all args at once. This fixed the failing tests.

```python
async def process(
    self, funcs: list[Callable[..., Any]], *args: Any, **kwargs: Any
) -> list[Any]:
    """
    Process multiple functions in sequence.

    Args:
        funcs: List of functions to process
        *args: Positional arguments to pass to the functions
        **kwargs: Keyword arguments to pass to the functions

    Returns:
        List of results from the function calls
    """
    results = []
    for func in funcs:
        # Process each argument individually
        for arg in args:
            result = await self.execute(func, arg, **kwargs)
            results.append(result)
    return results
```

### 2. Refactored `execute` method

The `execute` method in the `Orchestrator` class was refactored to reduce complexity by extracting helper methods:

- `_wrap_fallback_with_retry`: Wraps a fallback function with retry logic
- `_create_fallback_chain`: Creates a fallback chain for a given function
- `_execute_with_retry`: Executes a function with retry logic

This made the code more modular and easier to understand.

### 3. Fixed `FallbackChain` class

The `FallbackChain` class was modified to handle both single function and list of functions for fallbacks:

```python
def __init__(
    self, primary: Callable[..., Any], fallbacks: Callable[..., Any] | list[Callable[..., Any]] | None = None
) -> None:
    """
    Initialize a fallback chain.

    Args:
        primary: The primary function to try first
        fallbacks: Fallback function or list of fallback functions to try in sequence
    """
    self.primary = primary
    
    # Handle both single function and list of functions
    if fallbacks is None:
        self.fallbacks = []
    elif callable(fallbacks) and not isinstance(fallbacks, list):
        self.fallbacks = [fallbacks]
    else:
        self.fallbacks = fallbacks
        
    self.logger = logger
```

### 4. Refactored `with_retry` function

The `with_retry` function in `retry.py` was refactored to use a config object and kwargs to reduce the number of arguments:

```python
def with_retry(
    *,  # Force keyword arguments
    config: RetryConfig | None = None,
    **kwargs: Any,
) -> Callable[[Callable[P, R]], Callable[P, R]]:
    """
    Decorator that applies retry logic to a function.

    Args:
        config: RetryConfig object with retry settings
        **kwargs: Additional retry settings to override the defaults
                  (max_attempts, wait_min, wait_max, wait_multiplier, 
                   retry_exceptions, reraise)

    Returns:
        Decorator function that applies retry logic
    """
    # Create a config object if one wasn't provided
    if config is None:
        config = RetryConfig(**kwargs)
    elif kwargs:
        # Update the config with any provided kwargs
        config_dict = asdict(config)
        config_dict.update(kwargs)
        config = RetryConfig(**config_dict)
    
    return _with_retry_config(config)
```

## Next Steps

1. Add comprehensive logging throughout the codebase
2. Improve error handling in `retry_async` function to properly handle coroutine objects
3. Fix type compatibility issues in async/sync conversions
4. Implement proper handling of `AllFailedError` in all fallback scenarios
5. Optimize retry logic for better performance
