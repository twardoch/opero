I'll analyze the cleanup output and update the TODO.md file based on the current status of the project.

Looking at the cleanup output, I can see there are several issues that need to be addressed:

1. There are failing tests related to the `process` method in the Orchestrator class
2. There are linter errors in the codebase, particularly in `core.py` and `retry.py`
3. Some files are missing (LOG.md and .cursor/rules/0project.mdc)

Let me update the TODO.md file to reflect these specific issues and prioritize them.

  This document outlines the remaining tasks for the Opero project.
+ 
+ ## Immediate Priorities (v0.2.0)
+ 
+ 1. [ ] Fix failing tests in `process` method:
+    - [ ] Fix `test_orchestrator_process` - Currently returns `['Success: (1, 2, 3)']` instead of `['Success: 1', 'Success: 2', 'Success: 3']`
+    - [ ] Fix `test_orchestrator_process_with_concurrency` - Same issue as above
+    - [ ] Modify `process` method to apply function to each item individually rather than passing all args at once
+ 
+ 2. [ ] Fix linter errors:
+    - [ ] Resolve complexity issues in `core.py:execute` method (C901, PLR0912)
+    - [ ] Fix loop variable binding issues in `core.py` (B023 for `fallback_func`)
+    - [ ] Address too many arguments in `retry.py:with_retry` function (PLR0913)
+ 
+ 3. [ ] Create missing files:
+    - [ ] Create LOG.md for tracking changes and issues
+    - [ ] Create .cursor/rules/0project.mdc for project rules
+ 
+ 4. [ ] Add comprehensive logging throughout the codebase
+ 5. [ ] Improve error handling in `retry_async` function to properly handle coroutine objects
+ 6. [ ] Fix type compatibility issues in async/sync conversions
  
  ## Phase 1
  
- - [ ] Improve error handling in `retry_async` function to properly handle coroutine objects
- - [ ] Fix type compatibility issues in async/sync conversions
- - [ ] Ensure proper execution of individual functions in the `process` method
  - [ ] Implement proper handling of `AllFailedError` in all fallback scenarios
- - [ ] Add comprehensive logging throughout the codebase
  - [ ] Optimize retry logic for better performance
  
```

Based on my analysis of the cleanup output and the code, I've updated the TODO.md file to better reflect the current state of the project and prioritize the immediate tasks.

Here's a summary of the key issues I identified:

1. **Failing Tests**: The `process` method in the Orchestrator class is not working as expected. It's passing all arguments at once to the function instead of applying the function to each item individually. This is causing the tests to fail because they expect individual processing of each argument.

2. **Linter Errors**: There are several linter errors in the codebase:
   - The `execute` method in `core.py` is too complex (C901, PLR0912)
   - There are loop variable binding issues with `fallback_func` in `core.py` (B023)
   - The `with_retry` function in `retry.py` has too many arguments (PLR0913)

3. **Missing Files**: The cleanup output indicates that LOG.md and .cursor/rules/0project.mdc are missing.

I've reorganized the TODO.md file to prioritize these immediate issues, creating a new "Immediate Priorities" section that focuses on the tasks needed for the v0.2.0 release. I've also provided more specific details about each issue to make it clearer what needs to be fixed.

The most critical issue appears to be the `process` method, which needs to be modified to apply the function to each item individually rather than passing all arguments at once. This would fix the failing tests and ensure proper execution of individual functions.

Would you like me to implement any of these fixes, particularly the `process` method issue?
