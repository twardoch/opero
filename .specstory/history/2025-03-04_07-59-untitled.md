Periodically run `python ./cleanup.py status` to see results of lints and tests. Use `uv pip ...` not `pip ...` . Read current  @TODO.md  , update @CHANGELOG.md file that details all the changes we have done , update README.md so that it explains the project including the recent changes. Then run `./cleanup.py status` to see results of lints and tests, and update  TODO so that we have a `- [ ] item` list of things that actually are to be done next (remove things that are done, add things we should do next, re-prioritize existing items).

First, let's look at the TODO.md file to understand what's been done and what needs to be done.

```bash
